:summary: Least Authority performs security audit for SpiderOak

`Our mission`_ at LeastAuthority is to bring verifiable end-to-end
security to everyone.

As part of that mission, in addition to operating the `S4`_ simple secure
storage service, we also run a security consulting business. We
LeastAuthoritarians have extensive experience in security and
cryptography, and other companies pay us to analyze the security of their
protocols and software.

Almost all of our consulting clients are making Free and Open Source
software which protects user freedoms and works against censorship. It is
wonderful that in this day and age we can get paid to work on software in
the public interest.

One of our clients is `SpiderOak`_, a company who, like LeastAuthority,
sells cloud storage with end-to-end encryption. They didn't hire us to
evaluate the security of their current storage product (that would be a
big job!), but instead to do a limited, two-week long, security audit of
their new `Crypton.io`_ framework.

It was a fun project because we got to learn some of the details of the
`Crypton.io` design and implementation. We came away with a favorable
impression of the professionalism and good engineering practices of the
SpiderOak team. `Crypton.io` is all Free and Open Source software, and it
is designed for real, end-to-end security, which is part of why we wanted
to take the job.

Today SpiderOak `has published the security auditing report`_. We'd like
to thank them for producing `Crypton.io`, subjecting it to this kind of
independent review, and publishing the complete results. That's the right
way to do things!

The next security audit that we performed, was for the `Cryptocat`_
secure chat app. We expect the report from that to also be published
soon. Stay tuned!
