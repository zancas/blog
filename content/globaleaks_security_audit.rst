:summary: Least Authority performs security audit for GlobaLeaks

At Least Authority, `our mission`_ is to bring verifiable end-to-end security to
everyone. As a part of this mission, we provide security consulting services to
free and open-source software projects. We also run a verifiably-secure cloud
backup system, `S4`_.

In the past, we've performed successful security audits of `SpiderOak's Crypton
project`_ and of `Cryptocat`_. Continuing this series of security audits, we've
completed an audit of the `GlobaLeaks whistleblowing framework`_.

This audit was funded by the Open Technology Fund (OTF). Regular security audits
are an important part of the development of any software, and free and open
source internet freedom software is certainly no exception. We applaud OTF for
funding these highly beneficial audits.

Audit Results
--------------

Protecting whistleblowers is no easy task, especially since they may be up
against powerful adversaries (governments, corporations, and criminal
organisations) and the consequences of getting caught may be grave. It's
unlikely that a single technical solution to this problem exists. To keep
whistleblowers safe, any technical solution needs to be paired with OPSEC
education.

One of the things we liked about the GlobaLeaks project is that it has OPSEC
education and checks built right in to the user interface.

We identified several security issues in the GlobaLeaks software. You can read
about each issue in the `audit report`_. The issues have been addressed by the
GlobaLeaks team in the latest stable version.
