:summary: Least Authority Enterprises has joined the Open Invention Network to protect Linux from the software patent wars. 

Least Authority Enterprises has joined the ranks of the `licensees`_ of the Open Invention Network! `Open Invention Network`_ maintains a royalty-free patent pool that anyone who agrees to never assert patent claims against the Linux kernel can use. This both gives Linux a retaliatory weapon against future patent trolls and forestalls intellectual property related fear and uncertainty among potential corporate users of Linux.
